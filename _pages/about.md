I’m a data scientist at <a href="https://www.lab41.org/">Lab 41</a>, where I do machine learning research on problems of interest to US intelligence agencies.

My current work is focused on biomedical applications: using homomorphic encryption for secure multiparty queries of privately held genomic databases, machine learning for the detection and functional characterization of synthetic DNA, and studying the potential for information leakage from models trained on sensitive medical data. 

In 2017, I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine. I decided early in medical school not to do a clinical residency, and I spent most of my time building and implanting micro-electrode arrays (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26779949">including one that dissolves completely!</a>). Before medical school, I graduated summa cum laude in Biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania.

My career goals are to advance the state of machine learning research in biological and medical contexts and to help bring learning algorithms into clinical practice.
